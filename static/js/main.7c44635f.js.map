This tutor is designed to describe\\n     enough of the commands that you will be able to easily use Vim as\\n     an all-purpose editor.\\n\\n     The approximate time required to complete the tutor is 25-30 minutes,\\n     depending upon how much time is spent with experimentation.\\n\\n     ATTENTION:\\n     The commands in the lessons will modify the text.  Make a copy of this\\n     file to practise on (if you started \\\"vimtutor\\\" this is already a copy).\\n\\n     It is important to remember that this tutor is set up to teach by\\n     use.  That means that you need to execute the commands to learn them\\n     properly.  If you only read the text, you will forget the commands!\\n\\n     Now, make sure that your Shift-Lock key is NOT depressed and press\\n     the   j   key enough times to move the cursor so that Lesson 1.1\\n     completely fills the screen.\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n                        Lesson 1.1:  MOVING THE CURSOR\\n\\n\\n   ** To move the cursor, press the h,j,k,l keys as indicated. **\\n             ^\\n             k              Hint:  The h key is at the left and moves left.\\n       < h       l >               The l key is at the right and moves right.\\n             j                     The j key looks like a down arrow\\n             v\\n  1.

To undo previous actions, type:           u  (lowercase u)\\n     To undo all the changes on a line, type:  U  (capital U)\\n     To undo the undo's, type:                 CTRL-R\\n\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n                         Lesson 3.1: THE PUT COMMAND\\n\\n\\n       ** Type\\tp  to put previously deleted text after the cursor. **\\n\\n  1. Move the cursor to the first ---> line below.\\n\\n  2. Type  dd  to delete the line and store it in a Vim register.\\n\\n  3. Move the cursor to the c) line, ABOVE where the deleted line should go.\\n\\n  4. Type   p   to put the line below the cursor.\\n\\n  5. Repeat steps 2 through 4 to put all the lines in correct order.\\n\\n---> d) Can you learn too?\\n---> b) Violets are blue,\\n---> c) Intelligence is learned,\\n---> a) Roses are red,\\n\\n\\n\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n                       Lesson 3.2: THE REPLACE COMMAND\\n\\n\\n       ** Type  rx  to replace the character at the cursor with  x . **\\n\\n  1. Move the cursor to the first line below marked --->.\\n\\n  2. Move the cursor so that it is on top of the first error.\\n\\n  3. Type   r\\tand then the character which should be there.\\n\\n  4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the first line is equal to the second one.\\n\\n--->  Whan this lime was tuoed in, someone presswd some wrojg keys!\\n--->  When this line was typed in, someone pressed some wrong keys!\\n\\n  5. Now move on to Lesson 3.3.\\n\\nNOTE: Remember that you should be learning by doing, not memorization.\\n\\n\\n\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n                        Lesson 3.3: THE CHANGE OPERATOR\\n\\n\\n           ** To change until the end of a word, type  ce . **\\n\\n  1. Move the cursor to the first line below marked --->.\\n\\n  2. Place the cursor on the  u  in  lubw.\\n\\n  3. Type  ce  and the correct word (in this case, type  ine ).\\n\\n  4. Press <ESC> and move to the next character that needs to be changed.\\n\\n  5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until the first sentence is the same as the second.\\n\\n---> This lubw has a few wptfd that mrrf changing usf the change operator.\\n---> This line has a few words that need changing using the change operator.\\n\\nNotice that  ce  deletes the word and places you in Insert mode.\\n\\n\\n\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n                       Lesson 3.4: MORE CHANGES USING c\\n\\n\\n     ** The change operator is used with the same motions as delete. **\\n\\n  1. The change operator works in the same way as delete.  The format is:\\n\\n         c    [number]   motion\\n\\n  2. The motions are the same, such as   w (word) and  $ (end of line).\\n\\n  3. Move to the first line below marked --->.\\n\\n  4. Move the cursor to the first error.\\n\\n  5. Type  c$  and type the rest of the line like the second and press <ESC>.\\n\\n---> The end of this line needs some help to make it like the second.\\n---> The end of this line needs to be corrected using the  c$  command.\\n\\nNOTE:  You can use the Backspace key to correct mistakes while typing.\\n\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n                               Lesson 3 SUMMARY\\n\\n\\n  1. To put back text that has just been deleted, type   p .  This puts the\\n     deleted text AFTER the cursor (if a line was deleted it will go on the\\n     line below the cursor).\\n\\n  2. To replace the character under the cursor, type   r   and then the\\n     character you want to have there.\\n\\n  3. The change operator allows you to change from the cursor to where the\\n     motion takes you.  eg. Type  ce  to change from the cursor to the end of\\n     the word,  c$  to change to the end of a line.\\n\\n  4. The format for change is:\\n\\n         c   [number]   motion\\n\\nNow go on to the next lesson.\\n\\n\\n\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n                  Lesson 4.1: CURSOR LOCATION AND FILE STATUS\\n\\n  ** Type CTRL-G to show your location in the file and the file status.\\n     Type  G  to move to a line in the file. **\\n\\n  NOTE: Read this entire lesson before executing any of the steps!!\\n\\n  1. Hold down the Ctrl key and press  g .  We call this CTRL-G.\\n     A message will appear at the bottom of the page with the filename and the\\n     position in the file.  Remember the line number for Step 3.\\n\\nNOTE:  You may see the cursor position in the lower right corner of the screen\\n       This happens when the 'ruler' option is set (see  :help 'ruler'  )\\n\\n  2. Press  G  to move you to the bottom of the file.\\n     Type  gg  to move you to the start of the file.\\n\\n  3. Type the number of the line you were on and then  G .  This will\\n     return you to the line you were on when you first pressed CTRL-G.\\n\\n  4. If you feel confident to do this, execute steps 1 through 3.\\n\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n                        Lesson 4.2: THE SEARCH COMMAND\\n\\n\\n     ** Type  /  followed by a phrase to search for the phrase. **\\n\\n  1. In Normal mode type the  /  character.  Notice that it and the cursor\\n     appear at the bottom of the screen as with the  :\\tcommand.\\n\\n  2. Now type 'errroor' <ENTER>.  This is the word you want to search for.\\n\\n  3. To search for the same phrase again, simply type  n .\\n     To search for the same phrase in the opposite direction, type  N .\\n\\n  4. To search for a phrase in the backward direction, use  ?  instead of  / .\\n\\n  5. To go back to where you came from press  CTRL-O  (Keep Ctrl down while\\n     pressing the letter o).  Repeat to go back further.  CTRL-I goes forward.\\n\\n--->  \\\"errroor\\\" is not the way to spell error;  errroor is an error.\\nNOTE: When the search reaches the end of the file it will continue at the\\n      start, unless the 'wrapscan' option has been reset.\\n\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n               Lesson 4.3: MATCHING PARENTHESES SEARCH\\n\\n\\n          ** Type  %  to find a matching ),], or } . **\\n\\n  1. Place the cursor on any (, [, or { in the line below marked --->.\\n\\n  2. Now type the  %  character.\\n\\n  3. The cursor will move to the matching parenthesis or bracket.\\n\\n  4. Type  %  to move the cursor to the other matching bracket.\\n\\n  5. Move the cursor to another (,),[,],{ or } and see what  %  does.\\n\\n---> This ( is a test line with ('s, ['s ] and {'s } in it. ))\\n\\n\\nNOTE: This is very useful in debugging a program with unmatched parentheses!\\n\\n\\n\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n                      Lesson 4.4: THE SUBSTITUTE COMMAND\\n\\n\\n        ** Type  :s/old/new/g  to substitute 'new' for 'old'. **\\n\\n  1. Move the cursor to the line below marked --->.\\n\\n  2. Type  :s/thee/the <ENTER> .  Note that this command only changes the\\n     first occurrence of \\\"thee\\\" in the line.\\n\\n  3. Now type  :s/thee/the/g .  Adding the  g  flag means to substitute\\n     globally in the line, change all occurrences of \\\"thee\\\" in the line.\\n\\n---> thee best time to see thee flowers is in thee spring.\\n\\n  4. To change every occurrence of a character string between two lines,\\n     type   :#,#s/old/new/g    where #,# are the line numbers of the range\\n                               of lines where the substitution is to be done.\\n     Type   :%s/old/new/g      to change every occurrence in the whole file.\\n     Type   :%s/old/new/gc     to find every occurrence in the whole file,\\n     \\t\\t\\t       with a prompt whether to substitute or not.\\n\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n                               Lesson 4 SUMMARY\\n\\n\\n  1. CTRL-G  displays your location in the file and the file status.\\n             G  moves to the end of the file.\\n     number  G  moves to that line number.\\n            gg  moves to the first line.\\n\\n  2. Typing  /\\tfollowed by a phrase searches FORWARD for the phrase.\\n     Typing  ?\\tfollowed by a phrase searches BACKWARD for the phrase.\\n     After a search type  n  to find the next occurrence in the same direction\\n     or  N  to search in the opposite direction.\\n     CTRL-O takes you back to older positions, CTRL-I to newer positions.\\n\\n  3. Typing  %\\twhile the cursor is on a (,),[,],{, or } goes to its match.\\n\\n  4. To substitute new for the first old in a line type    :s/old/new\\n     To substitute new for all 'old's on a line type       :s/old/new/g\\n     To substitute phrases between two line #'s type       :#,#s/old/new/g\\n     To substitute all occurrences in the file type        :%s/old/new/g\\n     To ask for confirmation each time add 'c'             :%s/old/new/gc\\n\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n                Lesson 5.1: HOW TO EXECUTE AN EXTERNAL COMMAND\\n\\n\\n   ** Type  :!\\tfollowed by an external command to execute that command. **\\n\\n  1. Type the familiar command\\t:  to set the cursor at the bottom of the\\n     screen.  This allows you to enter a command-line command.\\n\\n  2. Now type the  !  (exclamation point) character.  This allows you to\\n     execute any external shell command.\\n\\n  3. As an example type   ls   following the ! and then hit <ENTER>.  This\\n     will show you a listing of your directory, just as if you were at the\\n     shell prompt.  Or use  :!dir  if ls doesn't work.\\n\\nNOTE:  It is possible to execute any external command this way, also with\\n       arguments.\\n\\nNOTE:  All  :  commands must be finished by hitting <ENTER>\\n       From here on we will not always mention it.\\n\\n\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n                      Lesson 5.2: MORE ON WRITING FILES\\n\\n\\n     ** To save the changes made to the text, type  :w FILENAME. **\\n\\n  1. Type  :!dir  or  :!ls  to get a listing of your directory.\\n     You already know you must hit <ENTER> after this.\\n\\n  2. Choose a filename that does not exist yet, such as TEST.\\n\\n  3. Now type:\\t :w TEST   (where TEST is the filename you chose.)\\n\\n  4. This saves the whole file (the Vim Tutor) under the name TEST.\\n     To verify this, type    :!dir  or  :!ls   again to see your directory.\\n\\nNOTE: If you were to exit Vim and start it again with  vim TEST , the file\\n      would be an exact copy of the tutor when you saved it.\\n\\n  5. Now remove the file by typing (MS-DOS):    :!del TEST\\n                                or (Unix):      :!rm TEST\\n\\n\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n               Lesson 5.3: SELECTING TEXT TO WRITE\\n\\n\\n        ** To save part of the file, type  v  motion  :w FILENAME **\\n\\n  1. Move the cursor to this line.\\n\\n  2. Press  v  and move the cursor to the fifth item below.  Notice that the\\n     text is highlighted.\\n\\n  3. Press the  :  character.  At the bottom of the screen  :'<,'> will appear.\\n\\n  4. Type  w TEST  , where TEST is a filename that does not exist yet.  Verify\\n     that you see  :'<,'>w TEST  before you press <ENTER>.\\n\\n  5. Vim will write the selected lines to the file TEST.  Use  :!dir  or  :!ls\\n     to see it.  Do not remove it yet!  We will use it in the next lesson.\\n\\nNOTE:  Pressing  v  starts Visual selection.  You can move the cursor around\\n       to make the selection bigger or smaller.  Then you can use an operator\\n       to do something with the text.  For example,  d  deletes the text.\\n\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n                   Lesson 5.4: RETRIEVING AND MERGING FILES\\n\\n\\n       ** To insert the contents of a file, type  :r FILENAME  **\\n\\n  1. Place the cursor just above this line.\\n\\nNOTE:  After executing Step 2 you will see text from Lesson 5.3.  Then move\\n       DOWN to see this lesson again.\\n\\n  2. Now retrieve your TEST file using the command   :r TEST   where TEST is\\n     the name of the file you used.\\n     The file you retrieve is placed below the cursor line.\\n\\n  3. To verify that a file was retrieved, cursor back and notice that there\\n     are now two copies of Lesson 5.3, the original and the file version.\\n\\nNOTE:  You can also read the output of an external command.  For example,\\n       :r !ls  reads the output of the ls command and puts it below the\\n       cursor.\\n\\n\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n                               Lesson 5 SUMMARY\\n\\n\\n  1.  :!command  executes an external command.\\n\\n      Some useful examples are:\\n         (MS-DOS)         (Unix)\\n          :!dir            :!ls            -  shows a directory listing.\\n          :!del FILENAME   :!rm FILENAME   -  removes file FILENAME.\\n\\n  2.  :w FILENAME  writes the current Vim file to disk with name FILENAME.\\n\\n  3.  v  motion  :w FILENAME  saves the Visually selected lines in file\\n      FILENAME.\\n\\n  4.  :r FILENAME  retrieves disk file FILENAME and puts it below the\\n      cursor position.\\n\\n  5.  :r !dir  reads the output of the dir command and puts it below the\\n      cursor position.\\n\\n\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n                         Lesson 6.1: THE OPEN COMMAND\\n\\n\\n ** Type  o  to open a line below the cursor and place you in Insert mode. **\\n\\n  1. Move the cursor to the line below marked --->.\\n\\n  2. Type the lowercase letter  o  to open up a line BELOW the cursor and place\\n     you in Insert mode.\\n\\n  3. Now type some text and press <ESC> to exit Insert mode.\\n\\n---> After typing  o  the cursor is placed on the open line in Insert mode.\\n\\n  4. To open up a line ABOVE the cursor, simply type a capital\\tO , rather\\n     than a lowercase  o.  Try this on the line below.\\n\\n---> Open up a line above this by typing O while the cursor is on this line.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n                        Lesson 6.2: THE APPEND COMMAND\\n\\n\\n             ** Type  a  to insert text AFTER the cursor. **\\n\\n  1. Move the cursor to the start of the line below marked --->.\\n  \\n  2. Press  e  until the cursor is on the end of  li .\\n\\n  3. Type an  a  (lowercase) to append text AFTER the cursor.\\n\\n  4. Complete the word like the line below it.  Press <ESC> to exit Insert\\n     mode.\\n\\n  5. Use  e  to move to the next incomplete word and repeat steps 3 and 4.\\n  \\n---> This li will allow you to pract appendi text to a line.\\n---> This line will allow you to practice appending text to a line.\\n\\nNOTE:  a, i and A all go to the same Insert mode, the only difference is where\\n       the characters are inserted.\\n\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n                    Lesson 6.3: ANOTHER WAY TO REPLACE\\n\\n\\n      ** Type a capital  R  to replace more than one character. **\\n\\n  1. Move the cursor to the first line below marked --->.  Move the cursor to\\n     the beginning of the first  xxx .\\n\\n  2. Now press  R  and type the number below it in the second line, so that it\\n     replaces the xxx .\\n\\n  3. Press <ESC> to leave Replace mode.  Notice that the rest of the line\\n     remains unmodified.\\n\\n  4. Repeat the steps to replace the remaining xxx.\\n\\n---> Adding 123 to xxx gives you xxx.\\n---> Adding 123 to 456 gives you 579.\\n\\nNOTE:  Replace mode is like Insert mode, but every typed character deletes an\\n       existing character.\\n\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n                        Lesson 6.4: COPY AND PASTE TEXT\\n\\n\\n          ** Use the  y  operator to copy text and  p  to paste it **\\n\\n  1. Go to the line marked with ---> below and place the cursor after \\\"a)\\\".\\n  \\n  2. Start Visual mode with  v  and move the cursor to just before \\\"first\\\".\\n  \\n  3. Type  y  to yank (copy) the highlighted text.\\n\\n  4. Move the cursor to the end of the next line:  j$\\n\\n  5. Type  p  to put (paste) the text.  Then type:  a second <ESC> .\\n\\n  6. Use Visual mode to select \\\" item.\\\", yank it with  y , move to the end of\\n     the next line with  j$  and put the text there with  p .\\n\\n--->  a) this is the first item.\\n      b)\\n\\n  NOTE: you can also use  y  as an operator;  yw  yanks one word.\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n                            Lesson 6.5: SET OPTION\\n\\n\\n          ** Set an option so a search or substitute ignores case **\\n\\n  1. Search for 'ignore' by entering:   /ignore  <ENTER>\\n     Repeat several times by pressing  n .\\n\\n  2. Set the 'ic' (Ignore case) option by entering:   :set ic\\n\\n  3. Now search for 'ignore' again by pressing  n\\n     Notice that Ignore and IGNORE are now also found.\\n\\n  4. Set the 'hlsearch' and 'incsearch' options:  :set hls is\\n\\n  5. Now type the search command again and see what happens:  /ignore <ENTER>\\n\\n  6. To disable ignoring case enter:  :set noic\\n\\nNOTE:  To remove the highlighting of matches enter:   :nohlsearch \\nNOTE:  If you want to ignore case for just one search command, use  \\\\c\\n       in the phrase:  /ignore\\\\c  <ENTER>\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n                               Lesson 6 SUMMARY\\n\\n  1. Type  o  to open a line BELOW the cursor and start Insert mode.\\n     Type  O  to open a line ABOVE the cursor.\\n\\n  2. Type  a  to insert text AFTER the cursor.\\n     Type  A  to insert text after the end of the line.\\n\\n  3. The  e  command moves to the end of a word.\\n\\n  4. The  y  operator yanks (copies) text,  p  puts (pastes) it.\\n\\n  5. Typing a capital  R  enters Replace mode until  <ESC>  is pressed.\\n\\n  6. Typing \\\":set xxx\\\" sets the option \\\"xxx\\\".  Some options are:\\n        'ic' 'ignorecase'       ignore upper/lower case when searching\\n        'is' 'incsearch'        show partial matches for a search phrase\\n        'hls' 'hlsearch'        highlight all matching phrases\\n     You can either use the long or the short option name.\\n\\n  7. Prepend \\\"no\\\" to switch an option off:   :set noic\\n\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n                       Lesson 7.1: GETTING HELP\\n\\n\\n                      ** Use the on-line help system **\\n\\n  Vim has a comprehensive on-line help system.  To get started, try one of\\n  these three:\\n        - press the <HELP> key (if you have one)\\n        - press the <F1> key (if you have one)\\n        - type   :help <ENTER>\\n\\n  Read the text in the help window to find out how the help works.\\n  Type  CTRL-W CTRL-W   to jump from one window to another.\\n  Type    :q <ENTER>    to close the help window.\\n\\n  You can find help on just about any subject, by giving an argument to the\\n  \\\":help\\\" command.  Try these (don't forget pressing <ENTER>):\\n\\n        :help w\\n        :help c_CTRL-D\\n        :help insert-index\\n        :help user-manual\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n                      Lesson 7.2: CREATE A STARTUP SCRIPT\\n\\n\\n                          ** Enable Vim features **\\n\\n  Vim has many more features than Vi, but most of them are disabled by\\n  default.  To start using more features you have to create a \\\"vimrc\\\" file.\\n\\n  1. Start editing the \\\"vimrc\\\" file.  This depends on your system:\\n        :e ~/.vimrc             for Unix\\n        :e $VIM/_vimrc          for MS-Windows\\n\\n  2. Now read the example \\\"vimrc\\\" file contents:\\n        :r $VIMRUNTIME/vimrc_example.vim\\n\\n  3. Write the file with:\\n        :w\\n\\n  The next time you start Vim it will use syntax highlighting.\\n  You can add all your preferred settings to this \\\"vimrc\\\" file.\\n  For more information type  :help vimrc-intro\\n\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n                             Lesson 7.3: COMPLETION\\n\\n\\n              ** Command line completion with CTRL-D and <TAB> **\\n\\n  1. Make sure Vim is not in compatible mode:  :set nocp\\n\\n  2. Look what files exist in the directory:  :!ls   or  :!dir\\n\\n  3. Type the start of a command:  :e\\n\\n  4. Press  CTRL-D  and Vim will show a list of commands that start with \\\"e\\\".\\n\\n  5. Press <TAB>  and Vim will complete the command name to \\\":edit\\\".\\n\\n  6. Now add a space and the start of an existing file name:  :edit FIL\\n\\n  7. Press <TAB>.  Vim will complete the name (if it is unique).\\n\\nNOTE:  Completion works for many commands.  Just try pressing CTRL-D and\\n       <TAB>.  It is especially useful for  :help .\\n\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n                               Lesson 7 SUMMARY\\n\\n\\n  1.

This tutor is designed to describe\\n     enough of the commands that you will be able to easily use Vim as\\n     an all-purpose editor.\\n\\n     The approximate time required to complete the tutor is 25-30 minutes,\\n     depending upon how much time is spent with experimentation.\\n\\n     ATTENTION:\\n     The commands in the lessons will modify the text.  Make a copy of this\\n     file to practise on (if you started \\\"vimtutor\\\" this is already a copy).\\n\\n     It is important to remember that this tutor is set up to teach by\\n     use.  That means that you need to execute the commands to learn them\\n     properly.  If you only read the text, you will forget the commands!\\n\\n     Now, make sure that your Shift-Lock key is NOT depressed and press\\n     the   j   key enough times to move the cursor so that Lesson 1.1\\n     completely fills the screen.\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n                        Lesson 1.1:  MOVING THE CURSOR\\n\\n\\n   ** To move the cursor, press the h,j,k,l keys as indicated. **\\n             ^\\n             k              Hint:  The h key is at the left and moves left.\\n       < h       l >               The l key is at the right and moves right.\\n             j                     The j key looks like a down arrow\\n             v\\n  1. Move the cursor around the screen until you are comfortable.\\n\\n  2. Hold down the down key (j) until it repeats.\\n     Now you know how to move to the next lesson.\\n\\n  3. Using the down key, move to Lesson 1.2.\\n\\nNOTE: If you are ever unsure about something you typed, press <ESC> to place\\n      you in Normal mode.  Then retype the command you wanted.\\n\\nNOTE: The cursor keys should also work.  But using hjkl you will be able to\\n      move around much faster, once you get used to it.

To delete from the cursor up to the next word type:    dw\\n  2. To delete from the cursor to the end of a line type:    d$\\n  3. To delete a whole line type:    dd\\n\\n  4. To repeat a motion prepend it with a number:   2w\\n  5. The format for a change command is:\\n               operator   [number]   motion\\n     where:\\n       operator - is what to do, such as  d  for delete\\n       [number] - is an optional count to repeat the motion\\n       motion   - moves over the text to operate on, such as  w (word),\\n                  $ (to the end of line), etc.\\n\\n  6. To move to the start of the line use a zero:  0\\n\\n  7. To undo previous actions, type:           u  (lowercase u)\\n     To undo all the changes on a line, type:  U  (capital U)\\n     To undo the undo's, type:                 CTRL-R\\n\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n                         Lesson 3.1: THE PUT COMMAND\\n\\n\\n       ** Type\\tp  to put previously deleted text after the cursor. **\\n\\n  1.

Type  c$  and type the rest of the line like the second and press <ESC>.\\n\\n---> The end of this line needs some help to make it like the second.\\n---> The end of this line needs to be corrected using the  c$  command.\\n\\nNOTE:  You can use the Backspace key to correct mistakes while typing.\\n\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n                               Lesson 3 SUMMARY\\n\\n\\n  1. To put back text that has just been deleted, type   p .  This puts the\\n     deleted text AFTER the cursor (if a line was deleted it will go on the\\n     line below the cursor).\\n\\n  2. To replace the character under the cursor, type   r   and then the\\n     character you want to have there.\\n\\n  3. The change operator allows you to change from the cursor to where the\\n     motion takes you.  eg. Type  ce  to change from the cursor to the end of\\n     the word,  c$  to change to the end of a line.\\n\\n  4. The format for change is:\\n\\n         c   [number]   motion\\n\\nNow go on to the next lesson.\\n\\n\\n\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n                  Lesson 4.1: CURSOR LOCATION AND FILE STATUS\\n\\n  ** Type CTRL-G to show your location in the file and the file status.\\n     Type  G  to move to a line in the file. **\\n\\n  NOTE: Read this entire lesson before executing any of the steps!!\\n\\n  1. Hold down the Ctrl key and press  g .  We call this CTRL-G.\\n     A message will appear at the bottom of the page with the filename and the\\n     position in the file.  Remember the line number for Step 3.\\n\\nNOTE:  You may see the cursor position in the lower right corner of the screen\\n       This happens when the 'ruler' option is set (see  :help 'ruler'  )\\n\\n  2. Press  G  to move you to the bottom of the file.\\n     Type  gg  to move you to the start of the file.\\n\\n  3. Type the number of the line you were on and then  G .  This will\\n     return you to the line you were on when you first pressed CTRL-G.\\n\\n  4. If you feel confident to do this, execute steps 1 through 3.\\n\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n                        Lesson 4.2: THE SEARCH COMMAND\\n\\n\\n     ** Type  /  followed by a phrase to search for the phrase. **\\n\\n  1. In Normal mode type the  /  character.  Notice that it and the cursor\\n     appear at the bottom of the screen as with the  :\\tcommand.\\n\\n  2. Now type 'errroor' <ENTER>.  This is the word you want to search for.\\n\\n  3. To search for the same phrase again, simply type  n .\\n     To search for the same phrase in the opposite direction, type  N .\\n\\n  4. To search for a phrase in the backward direction, use  ?  instead of  / .\\n\\n  5. To go back to where you came from press  CTRL-O  (Keep Ctrl down while\\n     pressing the letter o).  Repeat to go back further.  CTRL-I goes forward.\\n\\n--->  \\\"errroor\\\" is not the way to spell error;  errroor is an error.\\nNOTE: When the search reaches the end of the file it will continue at the\\n      start, unless the 'wrapscan' option has been reset.\\n\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n               Lesson 4.3: MATCHING PARENTHESES SEARCH\\n\\n\\n          ** Type  %  to find a matching ),], or } . **\\n\\n  1. Place the cursor on any (, [, or { in the line below marked --->.\\n\\n  2. Now type the  %  character.\\n\\n  3. The cursor will move to the matching parenthesis or bracket.\\n\\n  4. Type  %  to move the cursor to the other matching bracket.\\n\\n  5. Move the cursor to another (,),[,],{ or } and see what  %  does.\\n\\n---> This ( is a test line with ('s, ['s ] and {'s } in it. ))\\n\\n\\nNOTE: This is very useful in debugging a program with unmatched parentheses!\\n\\n\\n\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n                      Lesson 4.4: THE SUBSTITUTE COMMAND\\n\\n\\n        ** Type  :s/old/new/g  to substitute 'new' for 'old'. **\\n\\n  1. Move the cursor to the line below marked --->.\\n\\n  2. Type  :s/thee/the <ENTER> .  Note that this command only changes the\\n     first occurrence of \\\"thee\\\" in the line.\\n\\n  3. Now type  :s/thee/the/g .  Adding the  g  flag means to substitute\\n     globally in the line, change all occurrences of \\\"thee\\\" in the line.\\n\\n---> thee best time to see thee flowers is in thee spring.\\n\\n  4. To change every occurrence of a character string between two lines,\\n     type   :#,#s/old/new/g    where #,# are the line numbers of the range\\n                               of lines where the substitution is to be done.\\n     Type   :%s/old/new/g      to change every occurrence in the whole file.\\n     Type   :%s/old/new/gc     to find every occurrence in the whole file,\\n     \\t\\t\\t       with a prompt whether to substitute or not.\\n\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n                               Lesson 4 SUMMARY\\n\\n\\n  1. CTRL-G  displays your location in the file and the file status.\\n             G  moves to the end of the file.\\n     number  G  moves to that line number.\\n            gg  moves to the first line.\\n\\n  2. Typing  /\\tfollowed by a phrase searches FORWARD for the phrase.\\n     Typing  ?\\tfollowed by a phrase searches BACKWARD for the phrase.\\n     After a search type  n  to find the next occurrence in the same direction\\n     or  N  to search in the opposite direction.\\n     CTRL-O takes you back to older positions, CTRL-I to newer positions.\\n\\n  3. Typing  %\\twhile the cursor is on a (,),[,],{, or } goes to its match.\\n\\n  4. To substitute new for the first old in a line type    :s/old/new\\n     To substitute new for all 'old's on a line type       :s/old/new/g\\n     To substitute phrases between two line #'s type       :#,#s/old/new/g\\n     To substitute all occurrences in the file type        :%s/old/new/g\\n     To ask for confirmation each time add 'c'             :%s/old/new/gc\\n\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n                Lesson 5.1: HOW TO EXECUTE AN EXTERNAL COMMAND\\n\\n\\n   ** Type  :!\\tfollowed by an external command to execute that command. **\\n\\n  1. Type the familiar command\\t:  to set the cursor at the bottom of the\\n     screen.  This allows you to enter a command-line command.\\n\\n  2. Now type the  !  (exclamation point) character.  This allows you to\\n     execute any external shell command.\\n\\n  3. As an example type   ls   following the ! and then hit <ENTER>.  This\\n     will show you a listing of your directory, just as if you were at the\\n     shell prompt.  Or use  :!dir  if ls doesn't work.\\n\\nNOTE:  It is possible to execute any external command this way, also with\\n       arguments.\\n\\nNOTE:  All  :  commands must be finished by hitting <ENTER>\\n       From here on we will not always mention it.\\n\\n\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n                      Lesson 5.2: MORE ON WRITING FILES\\n\\n\\n     ** To save the changes made to the text, type  :w FILENAME. **\\n\\n  1. Type  :!dir  or  :!ls  to get a listing of your directory.\\n     You already know you must hit <ENTER> after this.\\n\\n  2. Choose a filename that does not exist yet, such as TEST.\\n\\n  3. Now type:\\t :w TEST   (where TEST is the filename you chose.)\\n\\n  4. This saves the whole file (the Vim Tutor) under the name TEST.\\n     To verify this, type    :!dir  or  :!ls   again to see your directory.\\n\\nNOTE: If you were to exit Vim and start it again with  vim TEST , the file\\n      would be an exact copy of the tutor when you saved it.\\n\\n  5. Now remove the file by typing (MS-DOS):    :!del TEST\\n                                or (Unix):      :!rm TEST\\n\\n\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n               Lesson 5.3: SELECTING TEXT TO WRITE\\n\\n\\n        ** To save part of the file, type  v  motion  :w FILENAME **\\n\\n  1. Move the cursor to this line.\\n\\n  2. Press  v  and move the cursor to the fifth item below.  Notice that the\\n     text is highlighted.\\n\\n  3. Press the  :  character.  At the bottom of the screen  :'<,'> will appear.\\n\\n  4. Type  w TEST  , where TEST is a filename that does not exist yet.  Verify\\n     that you see  :'<,'>w TEST  before you press <ENTER>.\\n\\n  5. Vim will write the selected lines to the file TEST.  Use  :!dir  or  :!ls\\n     to see it.  Do not remove it yet!  We will use it in the next lesson.\\n\\nNOTE:  Pressing  v  starts Visual selection.  You can move the cursor around\\n       to make the selection bigger or smaller.  Then you can use an operator\\n       to do something with the text.  For example,  d  deletes the text.\\n\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n                   Lesson 5.4: RETRIEVING AND MERGING FILES\\n\\n\\n       ** To insert the contents of a file, type  :r FILENAME  **\\n\\n  1. Place the cursor just above this line.\\n\\nNOTE:  After executing Step 2 you will see text from Lesson 5.3.  Then move\\n       DOWN to see this lesson again.\\n\\n  2. Now retrieve your TEST file using the command   :r TEST   where TEST is\\n     the name of the file you used.\\n     The file you retrieve is placed below the cursor line.\\n\\n  3. To verify that a file was retrieved, cursor back and notice that there\\n     are now two copies of Lesson 5.3, the original and the file version.\\n\\nNOTE:  You can also read the output of an external command.  For example,\\n       :r !ls  reads the output of the ls command and puts it below the\\n       cursor.\\n\\n\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n                               Lesson 5 SUMMARY\\n\\n\\n  1.  :!command  executes an external command.\\n\\n      Some useful examples are:\\n         (MS-DOS)         (Unix)\\n          :!dir            :!ls            -  shows a directory listing.\\n          :!del FILENAME   :!rm FILENAME   -  removes file FILENAME.\\n\\n  2.  :w FILENAME  writes the current Vim file to disk with name FILENAME.\\n\\n  3.  v  motion  :w FILENAME  saves the Visually selected lines in file\\n      FILENAME.\\n\\n  4.  :r FILENAME  retrieves disk file FILENAME and puts it below the\\n      cursor position.\\n\\n  5.  :r !dir  reads the output of the dir command and puts it below the\\n      cursor position.\\n\\n\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n                         Lesson 6.1: THE OPEN COMMAND\\n\\n\\n ** Type  o  to open a line below the cursor and place you in Insert mode. **\\n\\n  1. Move the cursor to the line below marked --->.\\n\\n  2. Type the lowercase letter  o  to open up a line BELOW the cursor and place\\n     you in Insert mode.\\n\\n  3. Now type some text and press <ESC> to exit Insert mode.\\n\\n---> After typing  o  the cursor is placed on the open line in Insert mode.\\n\\n  4. To open up a line ABOVE the cursor, simply type a capital\\tO , rather\\n     than a lowercase  o.  Try this on the line below.\\n\\n---> Open up a line above this by typing O while the cursor is on this line.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n                        Lesson 6.2: THE APPEND COMMAND\\n\\n\\n             ** Type  a  to insert text AFTER the cursor. **\\n\\n  1. Move the cursor to the start of the line below marked --->.\\n  \\n  2. Press  e  until the cursor is on the end of  li .\\n\\n  3. Type an  a  (lowercase) to append text AFTER the cursor.\\n\\n  4. Complete the word like the line below it.  Press <ESC> to exit Insert\\n     mode.\\n\\n  5. Use  e  to move to the next incomplete word and repeat steps 3 and 4.\\n  \\n---> This li will allow you to pract appendi text to a line.\\n---> This line will allow you to practice appending text to a line.\\n\\nNOTE:  a, i and A all go to the same Insert mode, the only difference is where\\n       the characters are inserted.\\n\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n                    Lesson 6.3: ANOTHER WAY TO REPLACE\\n\\n\\n      ** Type a capital  R  to replace more than one character. **\\n\\n  1. Move the cursor to the first line below marked --->.  Move the cursor to\\n     the beginning of the first  xxx .\\n\\n  2. Now press  R  and type the number below it in the second line, so that it\\n     replaces the xxx .\\n\\n  3. Press <ESC> to leave Replace mode.  Notice that the rest of the line\\n     remains unmodified.\\n\\n  4. Repeat the steps to replace the remaining xxx.\\n\\n---> Adding 123 to xxx gives you xxx.\\n---> Adding 123 to 456 gives you 579.\\n\\nNOTE:  Replace mode is like Insert mode, but every typed character deletes an\\n       existing character.\\n\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n                        Lesson 6.4: COPY AND PASTE TEXT\\n\\n\\n          ** Use the  y  operator to copy text and  p  to paste it **\\n\\n  1. Go to the line marked with ---> below and place the cursor after \\\"a)\\\".\\n  \\n  2. Start Visual mode with  v  and move the cursor to just before \\\"first\\\".\\n  \\n  3. Type  y  to yank (copy) the highlighted text.\\n\\n  4. Move the cursor to the end of the next line:  j$\\n\\n  5. Type  p  to put (paste) the text.  Then type:  a second <ESC> .\\n\\n  6. Use Visual mode to select \\\" item.\\\", yank it with  y , move to the end of\\n     the next line with  j$  and put the text there with  p .\\n\\n--->  a) this is the first item.\\n      b)\\n\\n  NOTE: you can also use  y  as an operator;  yw  yanks one word.\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n                            Lesson 6.5: SET OPTION\\n\\n\\n          ** Set an option so a search or substitute ignores case **\\n\\n  1. Search for 'ignore' by entering:   /ignore  <ENTER>\\n     Repeat several times by pressing  n .\\n\\n  2. Set the 'ic' (Ignore case) option by entering:   :set ic\\n\\n  3. Now search for 'ignore' again by pressing  n\\n     Notice that Ignore and IGNORE are now also found.\\n\\n  4. Set the 'hlsearch' and 'incsearch' options:  :set hls is\\n\\n  5. Now type the search command again and see what happens:  /ignore <ENTER>\\n\\n  6. To disable ignoring case enter:  :set noic\\n\\nNOTE:  To remove the highlighting of matches enter:   :nohlsearch \\nNOTE:  If you want to ignore case for just one search command, use  \\\\c\\n       in the phrase:  /ignore\\\\c  <ENTER>\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n                               Lesson 6 SUMMARY\\n\\n  1. Type  o  to open a line BELOW the cursor and start Insert mode.\\n     Type  O  to open a line ABOVE the cursor.\\n\\n  2. Type  a  to insert text AFTER the cursor.\\n     Type  A  to insert text after the end of the line.\\n\\n  3. The  e  command moves to the end of a word.\\n\\n  4. The  y  operator yanks (copies) text,  p  puts (pastes) it.\\n\\n  5. Typing a capital  R  enters Replace mode until  <ESC>  is pressed.\\n\\n  6. Typing \\\":set xxx\\\" sets the option \\\"xxx\\\".  Some options are:\\n        'ic' 'ignorecase'       ignore upper/lower case when searching\\n        'is' 'incsearch'        show partial matches for a search phrase\\n        'hls' 'hlsearch'        highlight all matching phrases\\n     You can either use the long or the short option name.\\n\\n  7. Prepend \\\"no\\\" to switch an option off:   :set noic\\n\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n                       Lesson 7.1: GETTING HELP\\n\\n\\n                      ** Use the on-line help system **\\n\\n  Vim has a comprehensive on-line help system.  To get started, try one of\\n  these three:\\n        - press the <HELP> key (if you have one)\\n        - press the <F1> key (if you have one)\\n        - type   :help <ENTER>\\n\\n  Read the text in the help window to find out how the help works.\\n  Type  CTRL-W CTRL-W   to jump from one window to another.\\n  Type    :q <ENTER>    to close the help window.\\n\\n  You can find help on just about any subject, by giving an argument to the\\n  \\\":help\\\" command.  Try these (don't forget pressing <ENTER>):\\n\\n        :help w\\n        :help c_CTRL-D\\n        :help insert-index\\n        :help user-manual\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n                      Lesson 7.2: CREATE A STARTUP SCRIPT\\n\\n\\n                          ** Enable Vim features **\\n\\n  Vim has many more features than Vi, but most of them are disabled by\\n  default.  To start using more features you have to create a \\\"vimrc\\\" file.\\n\\n  1. Start editing the \\\"vimrc\\\" file.  This depends on your system:\\n        :e ~/.vimrc             for Unix\\n        :e $VIM/_vimrc          for MS-Windows\\n\\n  2. Now read the example \\\"vimrc\\\" file contents:\\n        :r $VIMRUNTIME/vimrc_example.vim\\n\\n  3. Write the file with:\\n        :w\\n\\n  The next time you start Vim it will use syntax highlighting.\\n  You can add all your preferred settings to this \\\"vimrc\\\" file.\\n  For more information type  :help vimrc-intro\\n\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n                             Lesson 7.3: COMPLETION\\n\\n\\n              ** Command line completion with CTRL-D and <TAB> **\\n\\n  1. Make sure Vim is not in compatible mode:  :set nocp\\n\\n  2. Look what files exist in the directory:  :!ls   or  :!dir\\n\\n  3. Type the start of a command:  :e\\n\\n  4. Press  CTRL-D  and Vim will show a list of commands that start with \\\"e\\\".\\n\\n  5. Press <TAB>  and Vim will complete the command name to \\\":edit\\\".\\n\\n  6. Now add a space and the start of an existing file name:  :edit FIL\\n\\n  7. Press <TAB>.  Vim will complete the name (if it is unique).\\n\\nNOTE:  Completion works for many commands.  Just try pressing CTRL-D and\\n       <TAB>.  It is especially useful for  :help .\\n\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n                               Lesson 7 SUMMARY\\n\\n\\n  1. Type  :help  or press <F1> or <Help>  to open a help window.\\n\\n  2. Type  :help cmd  to find help on  cmd .\\n\\n  3. Type  CTRL-W CTRL-W  to jump to another window\\n\\n  4. Type  :q  to close the help window\\n\\n  5. Create a vimrc startup script to keep your preferred settings.\\n\\n  6. When typing a  :  command, press CTRL-D to see possible completions.\\n     Press <TAB> to use one completion.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\n  This concludes the Vim Tutor.  It was intended to give a brief overview of\\n  the Vim editor, just enough to allow you to use the editor fairly easily.\\n  It is far from complete as Vim has many many more commands.
